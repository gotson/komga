/**
 * Locators are meant to provide a precise location in a publication in a format that can be stored and shared.
 *
 * There are many different use cases for locators:
 * - reporting and saving the current progression
 * - bookmarks
 * - highlights & annotations
 * - search results
 * - human-readable (as-in shareable) references
 * - jumping to a location
 * - enhancing a table of contents
 *
 * Each locator must contain a reference to a resource in a publication (href and type). href must not point to the fragment of a resource.
 *
 * It may also contain:
 * - a title (`title`)
 * - one or more locations in a resource (grouped together in locations)
 * - one or more text references, if the resource is a document (`text`)
