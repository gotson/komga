    <Summary>Neil Gaiman's seminal series, THE SANDMAN, celebrates its 30th anniversary with an all-new edition of THE
        SANDMAN VOL. 1: PRELUDES &amp; NOCTURNES!

         New York Times best-selling author Neil Gaiman's transcendent series THE SANDMAN is often hailed as the
        definitive Vertigo title and one of the finest achievements in graphic storytelling. Gaiman created an
        unforgettable tale of the forces that exist beyond life and death by weaving ancient mythology, folklore and
        fairy tales with his own distinct narrative vision.

         In PRELUDES &amp; NOCTURNES, an occultist attempting to capture Death to bargain for eternal life traps her
        younger brother Dream instead. After his 70 year imprisonment and eventual escape, Dream, also known as
        Morpheus, goes on a quest for his lost objects of power. On his arduous journey Morpheus encounters Lucifer,
        John Constantine, and an all-powerful madman.

         This book also includes the story "The Sound of Her Wings," which introduces us to the pragmatic and perky goth
        girl Death.

         Collects THE SANDMAN #1-8.
