# LibraryFormCreateEdit

Library creation and edition dialog.

It is built using a stepper that behaves differently depending on creation/edition:
- in creation mode, order of steps is enforced, and buttons to navigate between steps are shown
- in edition mode, any step can be edited. Navigation buttons are not shown.
